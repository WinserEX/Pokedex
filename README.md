# Pokedex

This is what some consider an **inevitable project** for any developer striving to master React.

Some time ago I did a more simple version of this project with vanilla js, so I thought that my days of dealing with the Pokemon API were finally over... 

Well, here we go again.

# Vite (ReactJs)

This project was created using Vite, so don't forget tu **run npm i** after you clone it or fork it.

If you want to run it, use **npm run dev**
